**Task:**

**Build a Negotiation Chatbot Using a Pre-trained AI Model**

**Objective:**

Create a chatbot that simulates a negotiation process between a customer and a supplier, leveraging pre-trained models like Gemini, ChatGPT, or other AI language models.

**Requirements:**

**1.	Basic conversation flow:** The chatbot should initiate a negotiation for a product price, where the user (customer) can either accept, reject, or propose a counteroffer.

**2.	Pricing logic:** Implement logic where the bot, guided by AI, has a set price range and can offer discounts or counteroffers based on the userâ€™s input.

**3.	User interaction:** Allow the user to input a desired price. The chatbot should respond using the AI model to simulate negotiation, either accepting the offer, rejecting it, or proposing a counteroffer.

**4.	Model Integration:** Integrate Gemini, ChatGPT, or any language model of your choice to handle the conversational aspect of the negotiation. You can use APIs or SDKs provided by the model for interaction.

**5.	Bonus (optional):** Implement sentiment analysis to improve negotiation outcomes. For example, if the user is polite, the chatbot might offer better deals.

****Technology**:** Use any programming language or framework, but you must incorporate a pre-trained AI model (e.g., Gemini, ChatGPT).
